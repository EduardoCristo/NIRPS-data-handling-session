## -> Clone the current repository

First create a folder in a convenient place before cloning it. Let's assume, to five an example, that we create the [place_a_name_here] folder on the home directory. From the terminal:

``` bash
>>> cd [place_a_name_here]
```
And then clone the repository:

``` bash
>>> git clone https://github.com/EduardoCristo/NIRPS-data-handling-session.git
```

## -> How to create a conda environment

Lets start by creating a NIRPS_dhs conda environment running python 3.9

``` bash
>>> conda create --name NIRPS_dhs python=3.9
```

Next activate it

``` bash
>>> conda activate NIRPS_dhs
```

Intall the requirements for all the packages we will be using.
